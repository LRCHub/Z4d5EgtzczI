I've been fighting you in vain
I'll never see through your eyes
I'm your shadow in the night
A dying fire in my heart for you
But you are cold
The truth is told
You and I are history

Every time I close my eyes
I see I'm always just behind
Holding on, I keep hoping and I
Don't want to let go
See I'm raising you up high
Standing right here by your side
Falling back into the light
Repeating our history

Living on
As a broken hero
As a broken hero
Living on
Lost in your soul
You're going on

Every time I close my eyes
I see I'm always just behind
Holding on, I keep hoping and I
Don't want to let go
See I'm raising you up high
Standing right here by your side
Falling back into the light

Repeating our history

Living on
As a broken hero
As a broken hero
Living on
Lost in your soul
You're going on
You're going on
